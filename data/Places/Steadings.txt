<b>Capture</b> When control of a resource changes remove that resource from the tags of the previous owner and add it to the tags of the new owner (if applicable). If the previous owner has a craft or trade based on that resource they now have need (that resource). If the new owner had a need for that resource, remove it.
<b>Profit</b> When a steading has more trade than its current prosperity it gets +prosperity.
<b>Surplus</b> When a steading has a resource that another steading needs unless enmity or other diplomatic reasons prevent it they set up trade. The steading with the resource gets +prosperity and their choice of oaths, +population, or +defenses; the steading with the need erases that need and adds trade.
<b>Aid</b> When a steading has oaths to a steading under attack that steading may take -defenses to give the steading under attack +defenses.
<b>Embattled</b> When a steading is surrounded by enemy forces it suffers losses. If it fights back with force it gets -defenses. If its new defenses are watch or less it also gets -prosperity. If it instead tries to wait out the attack it gets -population. If its new population is shrinking or less it loses a tag of your choice. If the steading's defenses outclass the attacker's (your call if it's not clear, or make it part of an adventure front) the steading is no longer surrounded.
<b>Opportunity</b> When a steading has enmity against a weaker steading they may attack. Subtract the distance (in rations) between the steadings from the steading with enmity's defenses. If the result is greater than the other steading's defenses +defense for each step of size difference (village to town, town to keep, keep to city) they definitely attack. Otherwise it's your call: has anything happened recently to stoke their anger? The forces of the attacker embattle the defender, while they maintain the attack they're -defenses.
<b>Clash</b> When two steadings both attack each other their forces meet somewhere between them and fight. If they're evenly matched they both get -defenses and their troops return home. If one has the advantage they take -defenses while the other takes -2 defenses.
